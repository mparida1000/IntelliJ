 * Problem Description
Given a binary search tree A, where each node contains a positive integer, and an integer B, you have to find whether or not there exist two different nodes X and Y such that X.value + Y.value = B.
Return 1 to denote that two such nodes exist. Return 0, otherwise.
Problem Constraints
1 <= size of tree <= 100000
1 <= B <= 10^9
