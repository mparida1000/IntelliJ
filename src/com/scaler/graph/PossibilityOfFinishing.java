 * Problem Description
There are a total of A courses you have to take, labeled from 1 to A.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 2 you have to first take course 1, 
which is expressed as a pair: [1,2].

So you are given two integer array B and C of same size where for each i (B[i], C[i]) denotes a pair.

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish 
all courses?

Return 1 if it is possible to finish all the courses, or 0 if it is not possible to finish all the courses.
