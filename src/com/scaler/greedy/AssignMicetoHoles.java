/**
 * Problem Description
N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accommodate only one mouse.
The positions of Mice are denoted by array A, and the position of holes is denoted by array B.
A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consume 1 minute.
Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
-10^9 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^9
